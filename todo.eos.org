* DONE add my own module
Added eos-cc-nav as module that contains some nav and keybindings.

Babel blocks must be of type emacs-lisp ala
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-abbrev org-mode-abbrev-table "sblk" "" 'skel-org-block)
#+end_src

Then they will get automatically tangled.

Also, must add a try-load to [[org:eos][eos.org]]
